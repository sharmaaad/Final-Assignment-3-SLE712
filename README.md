# Assignment-3
It is an assessment task which consists of few exercises focusing on bioinformatics. 

## Introduction
The assessment task is divided in to two main components. In the first part of the assessment, two different data files are imported from Github in to R for further analysis by using basic R coding such as ordering, subsetting, filtering, graph plotting of the data frame. Where, one of the files has data related to RNA-seq count for two samples of interest, the other file has contained the measurements of circumference of trees growing at two sites from past 20 years.
Second part of the assignment requires users to advance their knowledge in using Rstudio and Github. In order to solve the problems related to the gene sequences of microorganisms, functions to gunzip, create BLAST databases, mutate and BLAST a sequence, are being used in this part of the assessment. 

## Motivation
The aim of the assignment is not only to develop the skills of solving bioinformatics-based problems, but it is also empowering the user to access and operate a variety of tools such as seqinr, R.utils, rBLAST, ape, ORFik, Biostrings, invented by other users, to analyse the limits of BLAST. Moreover, the task will provide an opportunity to get familiarise with Github, Repository, Readme.md, Markdown format and RStudio which will be very useful in future when working as a part of a professional team on projects related to bioinformatics.
